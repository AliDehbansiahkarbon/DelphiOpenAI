## What is OpenAI

OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research organization founded in San Francisco, California in 2015. It was created with the purpose of advancing digital intelligence in ways that benefit humanity as a whole and promote societal progress. The organization strives to develop AI (Artificial Intelligence) programs and systems that can think, act and adapt quickly on their own ‚Äì autonomously. OpenAI's mission is to ensure safe and responsible use of AI for civic good, economic growth and other public benefits; this includes cutting-edge research into important topics such as general AI safety, natural language processing, applied reinforcement learning methods, machine vision algorithms etc.

>The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language or code. We offer a spectrum of models with different levels of power suitable for different tasks, as well as the ability to fine-tune your own custom models. These models can be used for everything from content generation to semantic search and classification.

This library provides access to the API of the [OpenAI service](https://openai.com/api/), on the basis of which [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) works and, for example, the generation of images from text using `DALL-E`.

## Installation

You can install the package from `GetIt` [directly](https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/openai-for-delphi) in the IDE. Or, to use the library, just add the `root` folder to the IDE library path, or your project source path.

## Usage

### Initialization

To initialize API instance you need to [obtain](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) API token from your Open AI organization.

Once you have a token, you can initialize `TOpenAI` class, which is an entry point to the API.

Due to the fact that there can be many parameters and not all of them are required, they are configured using an anonymous function.

```Pascal
uses OpenAI;

var OpenAI := TOpenAIComponent.Create(Self, API_TOKEN);
```

or 

```Pascal
uses OpenAI;

var OpenAI: IOpenAI := TOpenAI.Create(API_TOKEN);
```

Once token you posses the token, and the instance is initialized you are ready to make requests.

### Models

```Pascal
var Models := OpenAI.Model.List();
try
  for var Model in Models.Data do
    MemoChat.Lines.Add(Model.Id);
finally
  Models.Free;
end;
```

### Completions

```Pascal
var Completions := OpenAI.Completion.Create(
  procedure(Params: TCompletionParams)
  begin
    Params.Prompt(MemoPrompt.Text);
    Params.MaxTokens(2048);
  end);
try
  for var Choice in Completions.Choices do
    MemoChat.Lines.Add(Choice.Index.ToString + ' ' + Choice.Text);
finally
  Completions.Free;
end;
```

Review [Completions Documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) for more info.

### Chats

```Pascal
var Chat := OpenAI.Chat.Create(
  procedure(Params: TChatParams)
  begin
    Params.Messages([TChatMessageBuild.Create(TMessageRole.User, Text)]);
    Params.MaxTokens(1024);
  end);
try
  for var Choice in Chat.Choices do
    MemoChat.Lines.Add(Choice.Message.Content);
finally
  Chat.Free;
end;
```

Review [Chat Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) for more info.

### Images
```Pascal
var Images := OpenAI.Image.Create(
  procedure(Params: TImageGenParams)
  begin
    Params.Prompt(MemoPrompt.Text);
    Params.ResponseFormat('url');
  end);
try
  for var Image in Images.Data do
    Image1.Bitmap.LoadFromUrl(Image.Url);
finally
  Images.Free;
end;
```

Review [Images Documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images) for more info.

### Errors

```Pascal
try
  var Images := OpenAI.Image.Create(...);
except
  on E: OpenAIExceptionRateLimitError do
    ShowError('OpenAI Limit Error: ' + E.Message);
  on E: OpenAIException do
    ShowError('OpenAI Error: ' + E.Message);  
end;
```

#### Exceptions

* OpenAIExceptionAPI - errors of wrapper
* OpenAIException - base exception
* OpenAIExceptionInvalidRequestError
* OpenAIExceptionRateLimitError
* OpenAIExceptionAuthenticationError
* OpenAIExceptionPermissionError
* OpenAIExceptionTryAgain
* OpenAIExceptionInvalidResponse - parse error

### Proxy

```Pascal
OpenAI.API.Client.ProxySettings := TProxySettings.Create(ProxyHost, ProxyPort, ProxyUserName, ProxyPassword);
```

## Requirements
This library does not require any 3rd party library. It works on recent Delphi versions (10.3+). Althought not fully tested, it should also work on all supported platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS).

Since the library requires your secret API key, it's not recommended you use it on client applications, as your secret key will be exposed, unless you are sure about the security risks.
